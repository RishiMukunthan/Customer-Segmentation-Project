# Customer-Segmentation-Project
Customer Segmentation Project
In this project, for the given dataset with credit card usage data of 8950 customers of a credit card company, 
customer segmentation was performed using unsupervised ML algorithm (K-Means Clustering). 
For the clusters identified, the features were analyzed to assign meaningful label to the segments of the customers 
and further marketing strategies were prepared for each group based on their features (customer behavior).
